# Privacy Policy for Narrator+

## Who We Are

We are the developers behind Narrator+, A Text-to-Speech Voice Reader browser extension. 

## What Data We Collect and Why

### Personal Information

If you opt to use any of the Premium Voices within Narrator+, you will be prompted to sign in using an existing account (Google, Facebook, or Apple) or by creating a new account. Narrator+ will access your basic profile information, including name, email address, and a password you set up. This information is necessary for tracking usage and managing purchases related to the Premium Voices' monthly free tier limits. If you do not use Premium Voices, signing in is not required, and we do not collect any personal information.

### Browsing History

Your browsing history is not tracked by Narrator+. We understand the importance of privacy and ensure our extension operates with minimal browser permissions.

### Text Converted to Speech

For standard voices, text-to-speech synthesis is processed locally on your device, ensuring that neither the text nor the speech is sent online or stored.

For premium voices, the text is sent to our cloud servers for synthesis. We may use anonymized IP addresses and User-Agent data for analytics, abuse prevention, and service improvement. The servers might cache the text and speech temporarily but will not store them permanently.

### Geolocation

Selecting a server-based voice may utilize your anonymized IP address for geolocation purposes, aiding in analytics.

### Issue Reporting and Contact Forms

Information submitted through in-app issue reporting or contact forms on our support site may be stored for up to 6 months for customer support purposes.

### Analytics

We collect anonymous data on extension usage, including installation, usage frequency, and uninstallation events, to understand user patterns. This data is anonymized and poses no privacy risks.

## Your Data Rights

Should you provide an email address through our contact form or issue reporting, you have the right to request an export of your conversation data or its deletion.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any collected data with third parties.

## Compliance with Industry Standards

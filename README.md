# Narrator-Plus (Still under development)

This repository hosts both a website and a Chrome extension designed to enhance web accessibility by providing text-to-speech functionality. The website offers users the ability to input text and have it read aloud, while the Chrome extension allows users to have the content of any webpage read to them.

## Website

### Description

The website component of this project allows users to enter text into a text area and use a text-to-speech (TTS) service to read the text aloud. This feature is particularly useful for users who prefer auditory learning or those with visual impairments.

### Features

- Text input area for custom text.
- Play, pause, and stop controls for text-to-speech.
- Selection of different voices (depending on browser support).

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the website.
2. Enter the text you wish to have read aloud in the text area.
3. Use the controls to play, pause, or stop the reading.

## Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension extends the functionality of the website by enabling users to have the content of any webpage read aloud to them. With intuitive controls integrated directly into the browser, users can easily listen to articles, blog posts, and web pages without the need for additional software.
